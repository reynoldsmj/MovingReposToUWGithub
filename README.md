# MovingReposToUWGithub

Per younga3, two steps:

1. Get a UW Gibhub account (appears this step can also migrate our UW-Libraries organization to the UW Github)
1. Move all our bitbucket repos to our UW Github

## Getting a UW Github account
### 2020.06.29 requested that UW-Libraries org be migrated to UW Github (filled out form)
* form had "questions" box where i asked if moving to UW would break anything
* did request from my personal netid, so whole move thing tied to my netid. oops

## Migrating Bitbucket Repos
OK, so the only problem with migrating Bitbucket repos is, I think, that any that are tied to Ansible will need to have Ansible "git" paths updated
I guess I can start by migrating one or two of my repos
* Then share with group steps to take
* Then migrate rest of my own repos
* Then help others with repo migration as needed
